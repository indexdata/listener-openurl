# OpenURL standards

There are two OpenURL standards in existence: the informal version 0.1, which was only ever published as an HTML page, and the ANSI/NISO standard Z39.88 (OpenURL 1.0). They are wildly incompatible, but we aim to support both. The relevant documents are as follows:

* [OpenURL v0.1](openurl-01.pdf) (and my [summary](OpenURL-v0.1-summary.txt))
* [OpenURL v1.0](z39_88_2004_r2010.pdf) (and my [summary](OpenURL-v1.0-summary.txt))
