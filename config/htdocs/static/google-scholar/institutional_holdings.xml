A list of library's electronic fulltext subscriptions, to aid in linking
to the library.  Print holdings are not required, though they may help
the linking party show more links to the library.

This file lives on the library's website.  Common practice is to generate
it daily from link resolver's internal configuration files.  The linking
party periodically fetches it from the library's website to update its data.

The limit is 1MB per holdings file but there may be several files -
see http://scholar.google.com/scholar/institutional_links.xml .
Please also consider gzip compression, especially if you're hosting
holdings for many libraries (the 1MB limit is before compression).
